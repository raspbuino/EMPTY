Discharging Batteries down to almost zero not only just for fun
### Description
...will follow.
For now, I just wanted to have a running code at a save place. The code is implemented on an ATmega328P with three 33-Ohm restistors and a SD-card slot attached, using the analog input capabilities of this wonderful microcontroller for data acquistion during discharging three AA or AAA-Batteries at the same time. Some blinking LEDs are revealing whats going on inside. A brief description with some pics included (in german language...) can be found here:
